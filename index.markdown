# Bio

I am a PhD student at INRIA Sophia Antipolis, part of the [GraphDeco](https://team.inria.fr/graphdeco/) group. I am supervised by [George Drettakis](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/George.Drettakis/) and my interests include Global Illumination, Path Tracing, Path Guiding, Neural Rendering and Generative Models. I graduated with a diploma of Electrical & Computer Engineering from the University of Patras and got a MSc High Performance Computer Graphics and Games Engineering from the University of Leeds. I have interned at Nvidia and will be defending my PhD in June 2022!

Outside of rendering my interests include sports, repairing electronic devices and creating android apps.
