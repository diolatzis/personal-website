# Bio

I graduated with a Ph.D. from INRIA Sophia Antipolis, part of the [GraphDeco](https://team.inria.fr/graphdeco/), and during my studies I interned at Nvidia. I was supervised by [George Drettakis](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/George.Drettakis/) and my interests include Global Illumination, Path Tracing, Path Guiding, Neural Rendering and Generative Models. I graduated with a diploma of Electrical & Computer Engineering from the University of Patras, got a MSc High Performance Computer Graphics and Games Engineering from the University of Leeds.

Outside of rendering my interests include sports, repairing electronic devices and creating android apps.
